# PBL_2
# A Study on Early Detection of Throat Cancer Using Artificial Intelligence

## Project Type
Research-Oriented Analytical Study (PBL)

## Objective
To study existing AI techniques for early detection of throat cancer,
analyze their effectiveness and limitations, and design a conceptual
AI-based screening framework for future experimental validation.

## Work Completed
- Systematic literature review
- AI technique comparative analysis
- Data source categorization
- Conceptual framework design
- Prototype ML demonstration (educational purpose)

## Repository Structure
- literature_review → Paper summaries and analysis
- analysis → Sample ML comparison scripts
- framework → Conceptual screening architecture

## Disclaimer
This repository contains research analysis and a prototype demonstration.
It does not represent a clinically validated medical system.
